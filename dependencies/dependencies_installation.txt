Dependency Installation:
In addition to the core code base, some analysis techniques within CASPR require the use of additional software dependencies. These dependencies include
* 'qhull' - This is a convex hull library that is used throughout the *Workspace* analysis module.
* 'optitoolbox' - This is a MATLAB optimisation toolbox. The toolbox is used within the *Inverse Dynamics* and *Design Optimisation* modules.

Further information for setting up each of these toolboxes is contained below

qhull installation:
1. Go to the qhull website <http://www.qhull.org/download/> and download the latest version of qhull that is appropriate for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system in the file *README.txt*
3. To allow for CASPR to access the compiled qhull code, move the compiled versionof the code to the subdirectory *dependencies* that is located in your *CASPR* root directory.

optitoolbox installation
1. Go to the optitoolbox website <http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/Wiki/OPTI/index.php/DL/DownloadOPTI> and download the latest version of the toolbox.
2. Extract the downloaded folder (preferably into the *dependencies* subdirectory).
3. Open MATLAB into the directory of the extracted folder.
4. Run opti_Install to finalise the installation.
