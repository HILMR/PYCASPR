# Python Wrapper of Cable-robot Analysis and Simulation Platform for Research Open-Source Software (PYCASPR)
## Requirements
### matlab.engine
`python -m pip install matlabengine`
> Notice: More information can be found in https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html
## Run test examples
Open MATLAB and run `sharemode.m`

> Notice: Share mode is generally quicker! You should run this script before running the Python wrapper.

Then run
`python PYCASPR_test/test_ik.py`
> Notice: Make sure the workspace is correct! You'd better write scripts in this folder.
